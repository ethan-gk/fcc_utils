## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Disclaimer

These utilities were created using Microsoft Copilot AI by a FreeCodeCamp student with no prior Python experience. While every effort has been made to ensure the code is safe and robust, **it is strongly recommended that you back up all files before using these tools**. Use at your own discretion.

## üì¶ Included Scripts

### `build_fcc.py`

- Skips invalid or incomplete files
- Supports offline mode and optional file relocation

**Usage**:

python build_fcc.py [source_folder] [destination_folder] [--no-move] [--offline]
```

**Help**:

python build_fcc.py --help
```

### `fcc_sort.py`

Sorts folders and loose `.html` files in the current directory based on their contents.

- Moves folders into `JavaScript/`, `CSS/`, or `HTML/` depending on file types
- Wraps loose `.html` files into folders named after the file
- Only creates target folders if needed

**Usage**:
```
python fcc_sort.py
```

**Note**: This script has no parameters or `--help` option.
